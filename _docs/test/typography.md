## Headers

We start at Level 2 (##), the main header is provided by the title.

## Header two

### Header three

## Lead

Here is a Lead: a short introductory blurb
{:.lead}

## Paragraphs

To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

Like this...

## Emphasis

**Bold**  
*Italic*

## Code

Use the back ticks to show something is code, e.g. a command line action:

`This is code`

## Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph. Add `{:.note}`, `{:.tip}` or .
`{:.warning}` after to change the style:

> Basic blockquote.

> A note blockquote
{:.note}

> A tip blockquote
{:.tip}

> A warning blockquote
{:.warning}

## Lists
You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists.

### Ordered Lists

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers donâ€™t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

The default will display the number as steps:

1. Step one
1. Step two
1. Step three
1. Step four

If you want a normal list add `{:.list}` to the end:

1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item
1. Fourth item
{:.list}

### Unordered Lists

To create an unordered list use the asterisk (*) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item

* First item
* Second item
* Third item
  * Indented item
  * Indented item
* Fourth item

## Horizontal Rules

To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***) on a line by themselves.

***

## Links

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Link Title]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (./)).

Click here to go to the [Test Page](./).

For external links add `{:target="_blank"}` to the end, this tells the browser to open the page in a new tab and adds the icon showing it's an external link:

Here's a link to [Google](https://google.com){:target="_blank"}
