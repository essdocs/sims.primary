It is already possible to analyse conduct events and individual pupil conduct. This release provides two new reports that enable you to view the detail of conduct incidents across the whole school, or in a particular class or year group.

- Achievement Details
- Behaviour Details

These reports enable the selection of a date range and one or more groups to retrieve the information of on-roll pupils.

The generated reports display comments recorded by teachers, together with any recorded follow up actions and their status.
