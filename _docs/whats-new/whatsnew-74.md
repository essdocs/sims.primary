## Manage Letter Templates

Schools create a wide range of letters throughout the academic year. This facilitates consistency in content, language and layout. To make it easier to find a template, each template can be linked to a category.

### Opening Manage Letter Templates

1. Open the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Menu" %}.
2. Use the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Menu Search" %} to find the **Manage Letter Templates**
3. Use the **Search** panel to find a your template

A range of information can be included in your templates, such as your schoolâ€™s logo and address.

Once defined, these templates can be used to generate letters.

A range of tags can be applied to your templates (pupil data, pronouns, attendance** , etc.) so that when letters are generated, information relating to the pupil is drawn from SIMS Primary, producing a personalised letter.

## Create Letters

To generate letters, select the required letter template and a group of pupils.

The groups for which you can currently produce letters are:

- Classes

- User Defined Groups.

Letters are generated in the background so you can continue to use SIMS Primary throughout the process. A message will be displayed once the letters have been generated. The generated letters are presented in a single PDF file to facilitate download and printing. 

**Not applicable to schools that use the Inventory third party product or Dinner Money.
