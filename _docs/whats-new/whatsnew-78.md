Following customer feedback, three new Assessment reports have been provided: 

### Individual Assessment Results
This report benefits schools that use Programmes of Study. It looks at the individual pupilâ€™s overall subject and strand results for an assessments period. 

### Subject Assessment Results
This report benefits schools that use Programmes of Study. It looks at all pupils for a given subject and displays the subject overall result and the strand results.

### Individual Assessment Results by Aspects
Schools that are not following the curriculum scheme can now report on Assessment results for individual pupils using this report.

This report particularly benefits schools that do not use Programmes of Study and instead use traditional marksheets (although the report will work in both scenarios). It reports on the results of individual pupils for specific aspects and assessment periods.
