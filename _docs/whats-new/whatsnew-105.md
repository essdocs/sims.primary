Pupils who were made leavers in the previous academic year are given attendance code Z from the day after they became a leaver up to and including the last day of the previous academic year. If attendance codes exist for these pupils, they will be overwritten with the Z code.

Pupils are now displayed in Edit Marks only if the Leaver filter is used, on a date from the previous academic year.
