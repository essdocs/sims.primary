### Overview

The **Individual Conduct Dashboard** compiles information to enable better understanding of a pupil's behaviour.

* pupil comparisons with the rest of the class
* a pupilâ€™s position in the class based on point scores
* a breakdown of the types of achievements and behaviour incidents.
