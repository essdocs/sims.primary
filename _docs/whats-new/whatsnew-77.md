Schools can now create up to five custom named date ranges for the purposes of Attendance** reports.

It was already possible to produce attendance reports for ‘today’ and ‘year to date’ so you do not need to set up date ranges for these purposes. However, you may wish to set up a date range to report for a particular period, e.g. to support the running of reports for SEND reviews for a specific period of the current or a previous academic year.

> Please note that date ranges cannot span academic years.

All users can create and edit date ranges and delete date ranges that are no longer required.

Each date range displays the status (New, Pending or Ready) to notify users about the availability of date ranges in reports. When the status is Ready, new date ranges are available in the following attendance reports via School Reports:

- Attendance Analysis by Category
- Attendance Analysis by Code
- Percentage Attendance
- Attendance Analysis by Code for Individual Pupils
- Group Analysis by Vulnerability

Date range pickers in these reports now display the custom named date ranges that have been created by the users.
