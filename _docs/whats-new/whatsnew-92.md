## New sub-codes

There are two new sub-codes for I (Authorised Absence):

- I01: Illness: This is for pupils who are absent because of non-coronavirus related illness or sickness.
- I02: Illness - Confirmed case of Covid-19: This is for pupils who have a confirmed case of coronavirus.

There are seven new sub-codes for X (Attendance Not Required):

- X01: Non compulsory school age: This code is used to record sessions that non-compulsory school age children are not expected to attend.
- X02: Self-isolating with Covid-19 symptoms: This is for pupils who are self-isolating because they have symptoms of coronavirus but they have not yet had a positive test.
- X03: Self-isolating - contact with Covid-19 symptoms inside school: This is for pupils who are self-isolating because of contact with a case of coronavirus INSIDE the school setting (for example, individuals, classes, year groups or bubbles who have been sent home because of potential contact with a confirmed case of coronavirus within the school setting). Includes test and trace where it applies.
- X04: Self-isolating - contact with Covid-19 symptoms outside school: This is for pupils who are self-isolating because of contact with a case of coronavirus OUTSIDE the school setting (for example, a household member with symptoms or a confirmed positive test, or a social contact or a contact with someone from the local community with a confirmed positive test). Includes pupils advised to self-isolate through test and trace where appropriate.
- X05: Covid-19 Quarantine - self-isolating: This is for a pupil required to be in quarantine on arrival in, or return to, the UK.
- X06: Covid-19 Clinical Advice - Not to Attend: This is for the small number of pupils who have been identified as clinically extremely vulnerable who have been advised that they should not attend school.
- X07: Covid-19 Government advice - pupil not to attend: This is for pupils who as part of future local or national restrictions to education settings, set out in the Contingency Framework and related guidance, are specifically advised not to attend school for public health reasons.
