It is now possible to generate a Data Collection Sheet and a Medical Information Sheet.

To modify the collection sheets to your specific requirements, a number of optional sections can be incorporated from the pre-existing list.

By default, the collection sheets are available to download or print only for a period of 48 hours after generating.

Previous collection sheets can be viewed from the left-hand panel of the screen.
