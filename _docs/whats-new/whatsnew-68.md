Following a request from the DfE, schools in England can now record multiple reasons for an exclusion. Only the first three reasons for exclusion will be reported on in the School Census Spring 2021 Return.

To enable the recording of the additional reasons, the **Exclusion Reason** grid has been introduced. This replaces the **Exclusion Reason** field found in previous releases.

The following reasons for exclusion have also been added:

* Use or threat of use of an offensive weapon or prohibited item (OW)
* Abuse against sexual orientation and gender identity (LG)
* Abuse relating to disability (DS)
* Inappropriate use of social media or online technology (MT).

Schools in Wales continue to record one reason for exclusion. The exclusion reason named Other (OT) is no longer available for selection.
