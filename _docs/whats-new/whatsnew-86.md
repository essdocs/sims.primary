We have made some important changes to the Absences for the Current Academic Year table:

- All absences for the selected member of staff for the current academic year are displayed in this table, as are any open-ended absences.
- The View Absence History link has been renamed Historical and Planned Absences. Clicking this link displays all absences for the selected member of staff for previous academic years, together with any future planned absences.
