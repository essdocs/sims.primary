## Improvements

Improved categories
: Categorisation has been provided to ensure a clear separation of communications.

Inbound messages
: To cater for responses from contacts regarding communications sent from the school, an inbound process has been provided.
This also identifies when the sending of messages has failed.

Date retention
: A data retention banner has been introduced to indicate how long messages will remain before being removed by the data retention policy.

Add to Communication Log
: A new **Publish to Comms Log** has been added to the Message Creation dialog.
