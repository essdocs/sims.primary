Before the Summer holidays, we provided live schools with new attendance reports in Reporting > School Reports > Attendance Reports.

The new Whole School Filter is available in the following updated Attendance reports that can be found in Reporting > School Reports > Attendance Reports:

* Attendance Analysis by Category
* Attendance Analysis by Code
* Percentage Attendance
* Persistent Absence Summary
* Minutes Late
* Group Weekly
* Attendance by Vulnerable Groups
  
Group filters that you have created (User Defined Groups filters) are now available in the following Attendance reports that can be found in Reporting > School Reports > Attendance Reports:

* Percentage Attendance
* Persistent Absence Summary
* Minutes Late
* Attendance by Vulnerable Groups
  
For all other schools, attendance reports remain available from Reporting > Attendance Reports. These reports remain unchanged in this release. We plan to introduce the new attendance reports to all other schools during the Autumn term.
