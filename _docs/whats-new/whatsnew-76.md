Two new Attendance reports have been provided:

### Group Analysis by Vulnerability

This report supports an Ofsted requirement and displays summary attendance statistics by pre-selected key groups (Asylum Status, Child Protection Plan, EAL, Free School Meals, Gender, In Care, Paramedical Support, Pupil Premium, Service Children and Traveller).

### Individual Attendance Report by Code

Following valuable customer feedback, you can now analyse individual pupils or groups of pupils by attendance code. This is also required for MAT reporting.
