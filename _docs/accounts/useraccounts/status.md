title: The status of a user account
---

The status indicates whether a person's account is active or suspended.

## Status definitions

{% include icon.html url="user-alert" %} Not Invited
: The person is not yet invited to your organisation.

{% include icon.html url="user-arrow-right" %} Invited
: The person was sent an invitation but haven't yet accepted

{% include icon.html url="user-check" %} Activated
: The person has received an invitation and have successfully set up their account

{% include icon.html url="lock" %} Suspended
: The person user account is suspended by an administrator.

{% include icon.html url="user-off" %}  Inactive
: The person has left your organisation. By default, we hide inactive accounts from your search results.

{% include icon.html url="user-times" %} Deactivated
: As a site admin, this action can be done through the Site admin page to deactivate the user account from SIMSID (it removes/deactivates the link between User account and school from SIMSID). To grant access again, the user will have to be re-invited again. This can be used in situations when say a user/staff leaves the organisation and the site admin can deactivate their account (through the Site admin portal). Ideally they would have to terminate the memberships of security groups they belong to after this.
