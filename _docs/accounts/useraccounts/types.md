## User account types

SIMS has three basic types of user accounts:

Staff Accounts
: User accounts linked to a member of staff.

Non-Staff Member Account
: User accounts not linked to a member of staff. E.g. a user from a support team.

Service Accounts
: User accounts created for a background service. E.g. a 3rd party product or service.
